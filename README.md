# Final Project - Student Enrollment System (MySQL)

This project implements a normalized relational database for managing student enrollments, departments, courses, instructors, and more in a university-like system using MySQL.

## ðŸ“‚ Database Schema

The project uses the following relational tables:

- **students**: Stores student personal information and enrollment date
- **departments**: Holds department names
- **courses**: Contains course details linked to departments
- **instructors**: Instructor details linked to departments
- **enrollments**: Records which student is enrolled in which course
